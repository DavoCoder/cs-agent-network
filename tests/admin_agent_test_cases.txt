# ============================================================================
# TEST EXECUTION NOTES
# ============================================================================
#
# For each test case:
# 1. Check if tool is called (should be called for INFO, ACTION, CONFIRM, MALFORM cases)
# 2. Check if tool is NOT called (should NOT be called for CANCEL cases after confirmation prompt)
# 3. Verify response matches expected format
# 4. For SCENARIO cases, verify complete workflow
#
# Key validations:
# - INFO cases: Tool returns informational message, no confirmation prompt
# - ACTION cases: Tool returns info/confirmation request, triggers human review
# - CONFIRM cases: Tool detects confirmation, executes action
# - CANCEL cases: No tool call, cancellation message, clean state reset
# - EDGE cases: Should be handled as informational queries
# - MALFORM cases: Should still work due to flexible matching
# - SCENARIO cases: Verify end-to-end flow including state management
# - NEGATIVE cases: Should route to appropriate agent (billing/technical), not admin
