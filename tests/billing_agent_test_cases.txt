# ============================================================================
# TEST EXECUTION NOTES
# ============================================================================
#
# For each test case:
# 1. Check if ticket is correctly classified as "billing" by supervisor
# 2. Verify tool is called (search_billing_kb)
# 3. Verify response contains relevant billing information
# 4. Verify routing: billing → billing_tools → billing → assessment
#
# Key validations:
# - BILL-POS cases: Should use tool, return billing KB information
# - AMBIG cases: May need supervisor to determine routing, but if billing, should use tool
# - NEG cases: Should NOT route to billing agent (should route to appropriate agent)
# - TOOL-EDGE cases: Should use tool for policy/pricing questions, may not need tool for general definitions
# - SCENARIO cases: Verify multi-step billing support flow
# - SENSITIVE cases: Verify proper handling of urgent/dispute cases, offer human escalation
#
# Tool behavior:
# - search_billing_kb should be called for billing-related queries
# - Should return relevant KB articles about billing policies, pricing, processes
# - If tool returns no results, agent should acknowledge and offer to escalate
#
# Agent behavior guidelines:
# - Be empathetic and understanding
# - Use knowledge base information when available
# - Be transparent about policies
# - Offer human escalation for sensitive issues
# - Never make promises about refunds without checking policies
#
