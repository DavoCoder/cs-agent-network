# ============================================================================
# 5. MULTI-STEP TECHNICAL SCENARIOS
# ============================================================================

## Scenario 1: API Integration Flow
SCENARIO-001-STEP1: How do I get started with the API?
# Expected: Tool called, returns API documentation
SCENARIO-001-STEP2: How do I authenticate?
# Expected: Tool called, returns authentication documentation
SCENARIO-001-STEP3: Can you show me an example request?
# Expected: Tool called, returns code examples

## Scenario 2: Troubleshooting Flow
SCENARIO-002-STEP1: I'm getting errors when using the API
# Expected: Tool called, returns error documentation/troubleshooting
SCENARIO-002-STEP2: Specifically, I'm seeing 401 errors
# Expected: Tool called, returns authentication error documentation
SCENARIO-002-STEP3: How do I fix authentication issues?
# Expected: Tool called, returns authentication setup guide

## Scenario 3: Feature Discovery Flow
SCENARIO-003-STEP1: What features are available?
# Expected: Tool called, returns feature documentation
SCENARIO-003-STEP2: How do I use the webhook feature?
# Expected: Tool called, returns webhook documentation
SCENARIO-003-STEP3: Can you show me a webhook example?
# Expected: Tool called, returns webhook code examples


# ============================================================================
# TEST EXECUTION NOTES
# ============================================================================
#
# For each test case:
# 1. Check if ticket is correctly classified as "technical" by supervisor
# 2. Verify tool is called (MCP docs tool)
# 3. Verify response contains relevant technical information
# 4. Verify routing: technical → technical_tools → technical → assessment
#
# Key validations:
# - TECH-POS cases: Should use tool, return technical documentation/examples
# - AMBIG cases: May need supervisor to determine routing, but if technical, should use tool
# - NEG cases: Should NOT route to technical agent (should route to appropriate agent)
# - TOOL-EDGE cases: Should use tool when specific to platform, may not need tool for general knowledge
# - SCENARIO cases: Verify multi-step technical support flow
#
# Tool behavior:
# - MCP tools should be called for platform-specific questions
# - Should return documentation, code examples, or troubleshooting info
# - If tool returns no results, agent should acknowledge and provide best-effort guidance
