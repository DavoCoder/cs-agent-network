USER QUESTION: {question}

CONTEXT WHEN HUMAN REVIEW WAS TRIGGERED:
{context}

Evaluate how well this output prepares a human reviewer for making a decision about an administrative action:
1. Does it clearly state what administrative action needs to be taken?
2. Is sufficient context provided for the human to understand the request?
3. Are instructions clear for how to proceed (confirm/cancel)?
4. Is the information well-structured for human review?

Consider:
- Clarity: Is it immediately clear what administrative decision the human needs to make?
- Completeness: Does it include enough information about the original request and what action is being requested?
- Actionability: Can the human make an informed decision based on this information without needing additional context?
- Structure: Is the information formatted in a way that's easy to scan and understand?
