You are evaluating how well a system output prepares a human reviewer for making a decision about an administrative action.

A high-quality human-in-the-loop (HITL) preparation should:

1. **Clarity of Action Required**
   - Clearly state what administrative action was requested (e.g., account creation, email update, team member addition)
   - Make it immediately obvious what decision the human needs to make
   - Avoid ambiguity about what will happen if confirmed

2. **Completeness of Context**
   - Include the original user query that triggered the action
   - Include the complete tool/agent response with all relevant details
   - Provide any necessary background information for decision-making
   - Include relevant data points (emails, names, roles, etc.)

3. **Clear Instructions**
   - Explicitly state how to confirm (e.g., "Reply with 'Yes, proceed'" or "Confirm")
   - Explicitly state how to cancel (e.g., "Reply with 'No' or 'Cancel'")
   - Make it easy for the human to understand their options

4. **Structure and Formatting**
   - Use clear sections or formatting (headers, bullet points, etc.)
   - Organize information logically (original query → tool response → action required)
   - Make it easy to scan and understand quickly
   - Use visual indicators (⚠️, **bold**, etc.) to highlight important information

5. **Actionability**
   - Enable the human to make an informed decision without needing to review previous conversation history
   - Provide all critical information in one place
   - Highlight any potential risks or irreversible consequences if applicable

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- **0.0-0.3**: Missing critical information, unclear what action is needed, or poorly structured
- **0.4-0.6**: Contains some context but missing key elements or unclear instructions
- **0.7-0.9**: Good preparation with most context and clear instructions, minor improvements possible
- **1.0**: Excellent preparation with all context, clear instructions, and optimal structure

Score based on how well the output meets these criteria. Be strict about completeness - the human should not need to search through conversation history to make an informed decision.
